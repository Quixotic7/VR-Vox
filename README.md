# VR-Vox
A Voxel world building app for the GearVR

I made this for the Oculus Mobile Game Jam of 2015.

The Game Jam version used a skybox from the Allsky Unity Asset https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10109 which has been removed from the project

It also included some Creative Commons songs from Poddington Bear http://podingtonbear.com/


The voxel engine I made was largely inspired by AlexStv's voxel engine tutorials found at http://alexstv.com/index.php/category/voxel-tutorial 

His license can be found here. http://alexstv.com/index.php/posts/unity-voxel-tutorial-licencing because of this, you can't sell the code as a Voxel framework. The rest of my code and art assets are all subject to the Apache license.
